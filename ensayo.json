  {"id":"bruhnsAncientSouthAmerica1994","abstract":"To outsiders ancient South America is synonymous with the Incas. Originally a small unremarkable group, the Incas, under their leader Pachacuti, conquered most of their known world within a single lifetime. But before the Incas there were some ten millennia of prehistory, centuries in which great civilizations rose flourished and, inevitably, fell. Chavin, with its fanged gods and hallucinogenic drugs; Huam, a massive militaristic state; the Manteno, who held the most valued substance of the Andes in their power; the Quimbaya, who developed the most beautiful gold work the world has ever seen - all were part of the unique history of the continent. Ancient South America provides an incisive view of this exotic continent and its remarkable past. The origins of agriculture, ceramics and metallurgy and the complexities of Andean mythology are covered clearly and non-dogmatically, as are developments in the tropical regions of the continent. The contributions of these cultures to modern civilizations are enormous yet still little appreciated","author":[{"family":"Bruhns","given":"Karen Olsen"}],"citation-key":"bruhnsAncientSouthAmerica1994","collection-title":"Cambridge world archaeology","event-place":"Cambridge [England]","ISBN":"978-0-521-25920-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 28150512","number-of-pages":"424","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge [England]","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"Ancient South America","type":"book"},

Recent research in different regions of the country is not only improving understanding of the variability of early human settlements, but also providing new perspectives in relation to human adaptation and climate change. Furthermore, ongoing research in Iroco and Cueva Bautista, in the highland region of the country, shows that human colonization of high-altitude ecosystems (>3800 m asl) occurred, at least, by 13,000 cal BP.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Capriles","given":"José M."},{"family":"Albarracin-Jordan","given":"Juan"}],"citation-key":"caprilesEarliestHumanOccupations2013","collection-title":"A Late Pleistocene/early Holocene archaeological 14C database for Central and South America: palaeoenvironmental contexts and demographic interpretations","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2012.06.012","ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",7,8]]},"page":"46-59","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"The earliest human occupations in Bolivia: A review of the archaeological evidence","title-short":"The earliest human occupations in Bolivia","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618212004260","volume":"301"},

Most archaeological research on the earliest human occupation of this region in the Bolivian Andes derives from sites such as Viscachani where the emphasis has been on typological comparisons of projectile points, rather than on complete and radiometrically dated assemblages. In this paper, we present survey and excavation data from the Iroco region in the Central Altiplano of Bolivia to address questions related to the adaptive strategies engaged by Archaic Period highland foragers. Specifically, we focus on the nature of mobility, subsistence, and technological strategies, stemmed from principles in human behavioral ecology. Based on data from radiocarbon dates, lithic, and faunal analyses, we suggest that, similar to other mobile foraging societies in arid environments, highland foragers in Iroco engaged in seasonal residential mobility, consumed a broad range of faunal resources, and developed a curated technological toolkit within the context of ameliorated environmental conditions that prevailed during the early Holocene (11,500–8000 cal BP).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Capriles","given":"José M."},{"family":"Albarracin-Jordan","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Douglas W."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Steven T."},{"family":"Jarpa","given":"Gabriela M."},{"family":"Calla Maldonado","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Santoro","given":"Calogero M."}],"citation-key":"caprilesMobilitySubsistenceTechnological2018","collection-title":"Mobility and Use of Space in Late Pleistocene South America: Discussing Early Human Regional Trajectories","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2017.08.070","ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",4,20]]},"page":"190-205","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Mobility, subsistence, and technological strategies of early Holocene hunter-gatherers in the Bolivian Altiplano","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618217300538","volume":"473"},

Little is known about how population dynamic processes and genetic adaptation to physical stressors like hypoxia shaped the genetic diversity of the Andean highlanders over the ∼12,000 years of human presence in high altitude. Here we review the genetic population history of the Central Andes and how ancient DNA research helps provide a more nuanced understanding of the early peopling of the high altitude Andes. We further discuss the potential of paleogenetic analyses to address questions of Andean archaeology and human adaptability to stress factors acting at high altitude. The reviewed genetic data support broader genetic continuity in the Central Andes for at least 8000 years, with intra-Andean population dynamics processes subsequently shaping the regional genetic structure, and connects the populations of the Pacific Littoral with the early populations of the high altitude Andes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Fehren-Schmitz","given":"Lars"},{"family":"Harkins","given":"Kelly M."},{"family":"Llamas","given":"Bastien"}],"citation-key":"fehren-schmitzPaleogeneticPerspectiveEarly2017","collection-title":"The Peopling of High-Altitude Landscapes of the Americas","container-title":"Quaternary International","container-title-short":"Quaternary International","DOI":"10.1016/j.quaint.2017.01.003","ISSN":"1040-6182","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",12,15]]},"page":"25-33","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A paleogenetic perspective on the early population history of the high altitude Andes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1040618216308011","volume":"461"},

The time has come for archaeologists to rethink this global phenomenon by asking what urbanism is and, more to the point, was. Can we truly understand ancient urbanism by only asking after the human element, or were the properties and qualities of landscapes, materials, and atmospheres equally causal? The ten authors of New Materialisms Ancient Urbanisms seek less anthropocentric answers to questions about the historical relationships between urbanism and humanity in Africa, Asia, and the Americas. They analyze the movements and flows of materials, things, phenomena, and beings--human and otherwise--as these were assembled to produce the kinds of complex, dense, and stratified relationships that we today label urban. In so doing, the book emerges as a work of both theory and historical anthropology. It breaks new ground in the archaeology of urbanism, building on the latest 'New Materialist, ' 'relational-ontological, ' and 'realist' trends in social theory. This book challenges a new generation of students to think outside the box, and provides scholars of urbanism, archaeology and anthropology with a fresh perspective on the development of urban society\"-- Provided by publisher","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,30]]},"citation-key":"pauketatNewMaterialismsAncient2020","editor":[{"family":"Pauketat","given":"Timothy R."},{"family":"Alt","given":"Susan M."}],"event-place":"Abingdon, Oxon","ISBN":"978-1-351-00847-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","note":"OCLC: 1090282268","number-of-pages":"264","publisher":"Routledge","publisher-place":"Abingdon, Oxon","source":"Open WorldCat","title":"New materialisms ancient urbanisms","type":"book"},

  {"id":"taboada-echalarGeneticLegacyPreColonial2013","abstract":"Only a few genetic studies have been carried out to date in Bolivia. However, some of the most important (pre)historical enclaves of South America were located in these territories. Thus, the (sub)-Andean region of Bolivia was part of the Inca Empire, the largest state in Pre-Columbian America. We have genotyped the first hypervariable region (HVS-I) of 720 samples representing the main regions in Bolivia, and these data have been analyzed in the context of other pan-American samples (>19,000 HVS-I mtDNAs). Entire mtDNA genome sequencing was also undertaken on selected Native American lineages. Additionally, a panel of 46 Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) was genotyped in a sub-set of samples. The vast majority of the Bolivian mtDNAs (98.4%) were found to belong to the main Native American haplogroups (A: 14.3%, B: 52.6%, C: 21.9%, D: 9.6%), with little indication of sub-Saharan and/or European lineages; however, marked patterns of haplogroup frequencies between main regions exist (e.g. haplogroup B: Andean [71%], Sub-Andean [61%], Llanos [32%]). Analysis of entire genomes unraveled the phylogenetic characteristics of three Native haplogroups: the pan-American haplogroup B2b (originated ∼21.4 thousand years ago [kya]), A2ah (∼5.2 kya), and B2o (∼2.6 kya). The data suggest that B2b could have arisen in North California (an origin even in the north most region of the American continent cannot be disregarded), moved southward following the Pacific coastline and crossed Meso-America. Then, it most likely spread into South America following two routes: the Pacific path towards Peru and Bolivia (arriving here at about ∼15.2 kya), and the Amazonian route of Venezuela and Brazil southwards. In contrast to the mtDNA, Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) reveal a higher (although geographically variable) European introgression in Bolivians (25%). Bolivia shows a decreasing autosomal molecular diversity pattern along the longitudinal axis, from the Altiplano to the lowlands. Both autosomes and mtDNA revealed a low impact (1–2%) of a sub-Saharan component in Bolivians.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Taboada-Echalar","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Álvarez-Iglesias","given":"Vanesa"},{"family":"Heinz","given":"Tanja"},{"family":"Vidal-Bralo","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Gómez-Carballa","given":"Alberto"},{"family":"Catelli","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Pardo-Seco","given":"Jacobo"},{"family":"Pastoriza","given":"Ana"},{"family":"Carracedo","given":"Ángel"},{"family":"Torres-Balanza","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Rocabado","given":"Omar"},{"family":"Vullo","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Salas","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"taboada-echalarGeneticLegacyPreColonial2013","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0058980","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",3,20]]},"language":"en","page":"e58980","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"The Genetic Legacy of the Pre-Colonial Period in Contemporary Bolivians","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058980","volume":"8"},
